camera and display required.

| Test Procedure |
Check that /dev/video0 exists. If it does not exist, load the camera driver with the command:

 modprobe mxc_v4l2_capture

modprobe CAMERA_MODULE (CAMERA_MODULE should be replaced by the camera module on the related platform, e.g. ov3640_camera should be used here on MX51)

Check again for /dev/video0. If it is not there, the camera driver has not loaded successfully and the test has failed.

Type the following command.

 mxc_v4l2_overlay.out -iw 640 -ih 480 -it 0 -il 0 -ow 160 -oh 160 -ot 20 -ol 20 -r 4 -t 50 -do 0 -fr 30

Direct preview (90 degree rotation) the camera to the background, and set frame rate to 30 fps.

| Expected Result |
The image from the camera is displayed on the screen rotated by 90 degrees. Colors and image should be correct.
